Once you clone the code and run it as described below, the result of the HTML will be something like this: ![websiteDemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86434738/136714264-fa538983-6d80-4826-b90b-be8b03d5f0de.png)



## Installation
After cloning the code, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). See their respective documentation to ensure that they are installed correctly.

Alternatively, run npm install in the console atfer cloaning the code.

Once they are properly installed, navigate to the correct directory, open the terminal, and type "node index" to run the code.
