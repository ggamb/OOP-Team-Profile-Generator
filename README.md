## Description
I created this Team Profile Generator from scratch using JacaScript, Node.js, Inquirer, and CSS. This Team Profile Generator allows the user to build a team of one manager leading engineers and interns. To begin, the user navigates to the correct directory and runs `node index` in the console. The user is prompted to enter information about the manager, including their name, ID, email, and office number. Then, the user is prompted to add an engineer or intern. Depending on the selection, the user is prompted about their information. The user can add as many engineers and interns as necesary. Once the team is complete, a stlyed HTML and CSS file are created and written to the `dist` folder. Open the HTML page in your favorite browser and you can see information about your team like the screenshot below. Clicking email links automatically opens your compter's email app with the "to:" field populated with the employee's email. Engineer's github links also link directly to their profiles in a new tab.

## Installation
After cloning the code, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). See their respective documentation to ensure that they are installed correctly.

Alternatively, run `npm install` in the console after cloaning the code to install all dependencies.

Once they are properly installed, navigate to the correct directory, open the terminal, and type `node index` to run the code.
